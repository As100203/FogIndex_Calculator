I have often been faced with the question – what is the right time to go for an IVIBA? Is it after finishing graduation or after several years of work experience? Perspectives may differ—here I am giving mine. I will discuss the pros and cons of both—and suggest you decide what is best for you considering the circumstances you are under.

Doing an MBA right after finishing your graduation has the advantage of continuity of education since it is impossible to predict what situations can come up after many years of work, personal or professional, that may inhibit one from taking a 2-year break from a job.

Doing all education without a break, and then concentrating on the job helps both. On the other hand, doing an MBA after putting up several years of work has the unmistakable advantage of truly appreciating what is taught in the MBA course.

For example, it is impossible for a fresh graduate to fathom what Mergers and Acquisitions mean or Earnings per Share growth mean or its importance in the corporate context. They will go through the motions as a theoretical exercise with no bearing to appreciating the real application requirement.

But a person who has spent 5 years in the corporate world will have complete understanding of that. Hence considering all aspects, I would recommend that one does an MBA after at least a few years of experience. The 2-years that you will spend during the MBA will be a much better and valuable learning experience for you if you are armed with the experience behind you.
